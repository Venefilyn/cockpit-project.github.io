Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 352 and cockpit-machines 345:

## Shown a warning if the last shutdown/reboot was unclean

Cockpit's healtchard will now show warning when the system was shutdown uncleanly.

## Machines: New virtual machines don't get SPICE graphics anymore

Cockpit used to add both VNC and SPICE graphics when creating new virtual machines. Now only VNC graphics are added. We have made this change since Cockpit itself does not benefit from SPICE graphics and we think that opening the SPICE port for a running machine should be intentional on part of the user and not happen silently and surprisingly.

## Machines: Support for network port forwarding

Cockpit can now configure port forwarding for virtual machines on the user session.
