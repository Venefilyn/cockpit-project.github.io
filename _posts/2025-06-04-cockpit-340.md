Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 340, cockpit-podman 107, cockpit-machines 333, and cockpit-ostree 211:

## Cockpit

### Storage: Prevent modifying partitions in unsupported places

It was previously confusing and somewhat dangerous when storage page listed LVM2 Logical Volumes as having free space. This is now changed to include a notice and not display these partitions to prevent mishaps when we cannot support it.

![Screenshot showing off a notice inside a GPT partitions card saying "Unexpected partitions" in bold, followed by a description saying "Partitions are not supported on this block device. If it is used as a disk for a virtual machine, the partitions must be managed by the operating system inside the virtual machine."]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/340-storage-unsupported-partitions.png)

### UX improvements

- We now warn the user when renaming volume groups that contain the root filesystem as it might break the next boot.
- Health card items in overview page is now aligned correctly.

  _Thanks to [Albert Byiringiro](https://github.com/albert-byiringiro) for this contribution!_

- Various typos have been fixed.

## Cockpit Podman

### Podman Quadlets logs now links to their systemd service log page

A simple but quality-of-life improvement that adds a link from the Logs page in a Quadlet container to its systemd service counterpart.

![An image of a podman logs page for a container called "systemd-test" below the black logs box is a link saying "View test.service logs".]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/340-quadlet-service-logs-link.png)

### `podman-compose` no longer mistakenly listed as a service

`podman-compose` sets labels to containers that confused it for a quadlet systemd-service. This should no longer be an issue and allow users to stop, kill, or otherwise manage these containers.

## Cockpit Machines

### Virtual network interfaces can now select source mode

When adding a new virtual network interface you can now select between VEPA, Bridge, Private, or Passthrough for more flexibility with how machines are exposed to the network.

![Screenshot showing off new form selection, it includes an information button for "Source" as well as a radio button to select either VEPA, Bridge, Private, or Passthrough.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/340-machines-network-source-mode.png)
